Comments to the author
======================

This paper investigates efficient methods to collect
particle swarm robots to one position. It guarantees that
the optimal and greedy algorithms collect particles for a
bounded world. The authors provide good theoretical
backgrounds to the problem, but they should give more
explanations on the simulation results.

Comments on the Video
=====================

The video clearly shows the motivation of the research.
