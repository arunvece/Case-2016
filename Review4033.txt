Reviewer 5 of CASE, ISAM 2016 submission 8

Comments to the author
======================

This paper presents a technique to collect a swarm of
particle in a grid environment with a common input discrete
signal. The authors consider a swarm of particles
initialized in a grid world in which each position is
either free- space or obstacle. The proposed swarm’s
collecting approach is based on optimal and greedy
algorithms. This paper provides algorithms that collect a
swarm of particle to one position and compares these
algorithms on the basis of efficiency and implementation
time.

The paper is well interesting, despite some 
recommendations from the reviewer.

Introduction section is a bit confusing and should be
improved. It is lacking of a true presentation of the state
of the art, and the motivations and contributions of the
paper should be emphasized.
Probably, the section II could be merged with the
introduction section
Similarly, Section III could be merged within the section
IV.
In Sect. IV.A: O(4^{shortest path length}) could be
corrected as “O(4^{s}), with s the shortest path length “

In Sect. IV.D, : the reviewer does not understand the
“basic idea” described by Fig.6 

Sect. V: in the previous sections of the manuscript, the
authors make effort to distinguish small to large particle.
It will be convenient to provide some (at least
basic/preliminary) results for large particles to exhibit
their differences.

Comments on the Video
=====================

The submitted video describe suitably the result of the
proposed method for collecting a swarm in a grid
environment.
