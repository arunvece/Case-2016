Comments to the author
======================

This paper presents an efficient approach to collect
particles. This work seems sound and good results of the
method are reported. However, in the proposed approach, the
particles just move in 4 directions (right, up, left, and
down). Could the particles move in 8 directions (right,
right up, up, left up, left, left down, down, and right
down)?
